# ðŸš„ We are Migrating to Railway!

Hello, everyone!

We're excited to announce that we are migrating Bob away from the Raspberry Pi and onto Railway for hosting. After much consideration we believe this move will bring numerous benefits to both Bob's uptime and the overall user experience. Letâ€™s dive into the reasons behind this decision and the advantages you can expect.

## ðŸ“Š Why the Move?

### 1. Scalability
One of the significant advantages of Railway is its ability to scale. As Bob continues to gain more users, it's crucial to have a hosting solution that can grow with the demand. Railway provides the flexibility to scale resources up or down based on real-time needs, ensuring that Bob remains responsive and reliable as our community grows.

### 2. Ease of Deployment
Railway simplifies the deployment process via its integration with GitHub. This means we can implement updates and new features for Bob more quickly and efficiently. Automatic deployments ensure that Bob is always running the latest version with minimal downtime.

## âœ¨ What Does This Mean for You?

### More Features
With the ease of deployment and better resource management, weâ€™ll be able to roll out new features and updates more frequently. Expect new commands and improvements coming your way!

### Minimal Downtime
Thanks to Railwayâ€™s infrastructure, we anticipate minimal downtime for Bob! Yes, even when new updates are added! This also means you won't have to worry about internet or power outages affecting Bob's status.

## ðŸ‘‹ Farewell to the Raspberry Pi

 The Raspberry Pi 4 served us well and certainly made Bob feel cozy! In fact, Bob called the Raspberry Pi home not only for the last year, but for two previous versions of itself which weren't even written in C# but instead JavaScript *talk about a long time ago!*.  We, along with Bob, cherish the experiences and milestones we achieved while using it. However, as Bob's community has grown, we've realized the need for a more scalable and robust solution. Railway offers the uptime, and continuous integration features we so greatly missed with the Raspberry Pi 4. And so with that, we say fondly, "goodbye Raspberry Pi!"

Weâ€™re thrilled about this transition and the positive impact it will have on Bob and the community. Moving to Railway marks a significant step forward in Bob's quality and usability. 

Thank you for your continued support. Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback.
